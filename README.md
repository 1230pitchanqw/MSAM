# Paper reference:
"Update soon"

# Data preprocess:
This step require the claims data, which is not public available for many of the researchers. We will update a synthetic claims dataset asap.

# Model training:

`python3 train.py`

# Thoughts and future work:

please refer to the ppt files, it contains experiments that are not shown in the paper. We future summerize the overall experiments and update here.
